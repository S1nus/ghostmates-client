Todo:
- ~~Protocol Queue.~~
- ~~The client needs to be able to have multiple runs of A-Check and P-Check protocols going asynchronously.~~
- ~~I'll achieve this with some sort of lookup table.~~
- ~~Next milestone is multiple async protocol runs~~
- ~~After that, our next milestone will be validating the 128 beaver triples.~~
- After that, our next milestone will be a working P-Check
- A-Check is a cake walk compared to P-Check.
- After A-Check and P-Check i'll come up with a protocol to "complete the circuit"
- Then comes the blockchain stuff
